# Global Climate Change Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard focused on visualizing and analyzing various aspects of global climate change. It aims to provide insights into CO2 emissions, extreme weather events, and overall climate trends, helping users understand the impact and progression of climate change.

## Dashboards

The project includes three main dashboard views:

1.  **Global Climate Summary:**
    * **Purpose:** Offers a high-level overview of global climate trends and key indicators.
    * **Key Metrics:** Global temperature anomaly, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and potentially sea-level rise.
    * **Visualizations:** Includes cards for key global metrics, line charts showing trends over time (e.g., global temperature, CO2 concentration), and potentially a world map indicating regional anomalies.
    * **Interactive Features:** Filters for different time periods or regions to explore specific trends.
    * **Example Image:** `Global Climate Summary.jpg`

2.  **CO2 Emissions Analysis:**
    * **Purpose:** Provides a detailed breakdown of CO2 emissions by country, sector, and over time.
    * **Key Metrics:** Total CO2 emissions, emissions per capita, and historical emission trends.
    * **Visualizations:** Bar charts showing top emitting countries/regions, a treemap or pie chart for sector-wise emissions, and line charts illustrating historical CO2 emission trends.
    * **Interactive Features:** Filters by country, year, and emission source to deep dive into specific emission patterns.
    * **Example Image:** `CO2 Emissions.jpg`

3.  **Extreme Weather Events:**
    * **Purpose:** Visualizes the frequency, type, and impact of extreme weather events globally.
    * **Key Metrics:** Number of events by type (e.g., floods, droughts, storms), affected population, and economic damages.
    * **Visualizations:** Bar charts showing the distribution of event types, a choropleth map highlighting regions most affected, and line charts for event trends over time.
    * **Interactive Features:** Filters by event type, year, and region to understand specific weather phenomena.
    * **Example Image:** `Extreme Weather Events.jpg`

## Features

* **Key Climate Indicators:** Track essential metrics related to global warming.
* **Emission Insights:** Analyze CO2 emission sources and trends globally and by country.
* **Extreme Event Tracking:** Monitor patterns and impacts of severe weather occurrences.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Easily explore data by time, region, or specific categories.
* **Visual Trends:** Identify historical patterns and potential future trajectories of climate change indicators.

## Getting Started
